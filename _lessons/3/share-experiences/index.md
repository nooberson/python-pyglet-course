Games are fun! Let's begin with everyone sharing their gaming experiences - whether it is a fun gaming session with friends or family, something funnt that happened or just your all time favourite game, share it with others in the class, who knows you might learn about another great game you might like.

In most of the games players interarct with a virtual story world solving problems and overcoming challenges either through an avatar (like in Minecraft) or as themselves (puzzle games).

In this course we are going create a top down turn-based grid game where players move around a dungeon, collect items, solve challenges and overcome tough enemies.

Developing turn based grid games are great for beginners because they are easier to code than realtime non-grid games and provide a powerful game making foundation to make many classice games such as Tic-Tac-Toe (Naughts and Crosses), Minesweeper, Battleships, Tetris etc.

Think about any grid based games you have played, what are the common elements in these games? What properties does a grid have? What can each cell (tile) of the grid contain?

#### Instructor notes

- Try help every student contribute equally.
- You may need to ask what games they like playing on their phones.
- If someone doesn't play video games ask if they play any card or board games (tabbletop games).
