This course will teach you how to code with <a href="https://www.python.org" target="_blank">Python</a> by making a game with <a href="http://pyglet.readthedocs.io" target="_blank">Pyglet</a>.

No prior coding or game development experience is required. Each lesson will teach the necessary Python syntax and Pyglet APIs (Application Programming Interface) through examples and by encouraging you to experiment and change the source code.

## Learning to code

People who can't code assume those who can have some incredible gift to remember dozens of different langauges's syntax and APIs - but the truth is that has very little to do with being a coder.

Being a good coder means being good at facing a problem, breaking it apart and asking questions about it. We are fortunate to have incredible online services and resources to answer any question, especially at the beginner to intermediate level.

This course will teach you how to code but more importantly it will teach you how to ask the right questions. At first you will have to look up all the answers but gradually you will build up a set of common solutions - your problem solving building blocks - which you can use to solve more complex problems.

You should be searching for answers in the <a href="http://pyglet.readthedocs.io/" target="_blank">Pyglet Documentation</a>, specifically in the "Programming Guide" section on the documentation homepage, and in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/" target="_blank">Python Documentation</a>, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html" target="_blank">The Python Tutorial</a> is a great place to look for answers for beginners.

I hope you enjoy the journey.
